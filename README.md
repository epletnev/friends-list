# FriendsList app

A front-end React app that displays a friends list with a search function. 

The app fetches a list of users from the JSON placeholder API and then populates the page with user cards. For the user cards, the Unsplash API is used to fetch and display a random image for each user. The result can then be searched using the search field, which will match the user input to the user names.

Created with ReactJS, CSS, JSON placeholder API & Unsplash API.
